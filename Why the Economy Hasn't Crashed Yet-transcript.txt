=== TOP COMMENTS ===
1. @hankschannel (11,000 likes): Note, this video used to be called "Does the Economy Need Trump?" which is why a lot of the top comments look the way they do! 🤣
2. @BlackRose3610 (164 likes): I don’t think your take is inaccurate: the market remains sustainable because stability is purchasable through quid pro quo - should this not exist, then instability would look like instability in the market.
3. @iHartTrains2312 (37 likes): @BlackRose3610  Everybody would do well to read Marx
4. @BlackRose3610 (7 likes): @iHartTrains2312and heilbroner tbh
5. @BlackRose3610 (10 likes): Not only have we lost Marx but we appear to have lost Ricardo and Smith in terms of “present in the minds of the people”
6. @iHartTrains2312 (3 likes): @BlackRose3610 I hadn’t heard/seen of that compilation, will give it a read. Thanks!
7. @BlackRose3610 (8 likes): @iHartTrains2312you’re very welcome. It’s a good reminder that like “all of this is fluid, in development, and more changeable than we think”. Everyone looks at the s&p500 as an indicator of the day - for most of human history, we had tribalism. For most of human history, there was no “economy”. This is all relatively creative space.
8. @jasonclements9022 (6 likes): @BlackRose3610 I tried to explain to a family member what smith said as a popular philosopher of capitalism and they said it sounded like communism 😂 sigh
9. @earthcoloredeyes5043 (1 likes): @iHartTrains2312Edward Bernays.
10. @DrCruel (1 likes): @iHartTrains2312 I'm so tired of evangelical Left fascism. Karl Marx was a con man.
11. @DrCruel (2 likes): @earthcoloredeyes5043  James Burnham. Especially his letter refuting the Marxists.
12. @earthcoloredeyes5043 (0 likes): @DrCruel let’s dive!
13. @jjp1743 (1 likes): @BlackRose3610  Trump doesn’t follow any coherent economic philosophy. You can demolish his policies from any major economic philosophy, whether that’s Austrian Chicago Keynesianism classicalism or even actual  disproven economics like Marx.
14. @BlackRose3610 (0 likes): @jjp1743yeah the only question is if his strategy is “incoherent” or “clinically demented”
15. @BlackRose3610 (4 likes): @DrCruel evangelical left fascism, you critique, in a time of actual, right wing fascists butchering American citizens in the street, owned, aided, and abetted by a tiny group of ultra wealthy?
16. @tonyfubu (18 likes): @BlackRose3610  what the heck do you even mean? ... And wasn't Hank just the science reader/presenter guy, what does he know about macro economics, economics of scale, large-scale industry, specialty industry, b2b services, FIRE, etc. -- I would dare to say not much. most of Hank's rambling, in this video, seems to be at best pop-economics.
17. @BlackRose3610 (43 likes): Why is what is written above pop-economics and not accurate?
18. @tonyfubu (5 likes): @BlackRose3610  ok. so let's do this: what market are you referring too?
19. @spencerprice7085 (42 likes): @tonyfubu  okay well if he’s so wrong why don’t you enlighten us instead of just attacking his character.
20. @SamSimmonds-v1k (28 likes): ​​ @tonyfubu I know right crazy, it's almost as if he researched the topics professionally over probably an extended amount of time like I don't know, every other at a minimum somewhat successful YouTubers. When did he say he was a professional on the subject because I never heard him say so at all. 😂😂 1million gbp of your local currency if you can show me where he says he's a pro.
21. @kmesh9 (24 likes): @spencerprice7085  I like how that guy said “let’s do this” and then went quiet
22. @infrakazos (11 likes): @kmesh9  let's do thisn't
23. @tonyfubu (1 likes): @SamSimmonds-v1k  you think Hank "researched" every topic he has presented during his various jobs?
24. @patriciaVrosegurl (2 likes): ​ @BlackRose3610 pop-economics?
25. @tonyfubu (1 likes): @spencerprice7085  with basic reading comprehension skills, I believe anyone should be able to obtain that i never said a word about Hank's character.
26. @patriciaVrosegurl (0 likes): ​ @SamSimmonds-v1k mmm crash course?
27. @patriciaVrosegurl (0 likes): ​ @tonyfubu is that the thing about jobs before entering them? 😅
28. @BlackRose3610 (2 likes): @tonyfubu the US market, US FDI attraction, US business investment, US BERD, let’s say
29. @BlackRose3610 (11 likes): @patriciaVrosegurl yeah I think he’s trying to argue that what Hank is saying is like “in vogue dooming” and not a fair analysis of “why is what happened in Greece, Venezuela, the UK, France, etc., at various points in history with business investment and market investment NOT happening in the US right now?”  To which, I think, the argument that “instability decreases investment, but this regime is so corrupt you can buy stability for individual companies” is a fair point.
30. @BlackRose3610 (7 likes): @tonyfubu like the question posed is “why does business investment in the US continue, and why does capital investment in stocks continue, despite that current levels of instability have caused capital flight in dozens of countries over the last 6 decades?”  The administration is willing to openly topple foreign regimes, make hundred million dollar equity investments in individual companies, and completely de-regulate industries based on buying trump crypto. They’re willing to throw out sovereignty, free market capitalism, and any protections of citizens due to corporate bought favours. This is why capital isn’t fleeing; it can buy stability. If you’re worried about investing in US oil refineries, you can buy yourself a fiefdom in Venezuela, backed by the US government. You make a return on that investment because you can buy the conditions for it.

=== TRANSCRIPT (TIMESTAMPED) ===
[00:00] So for over a year now, I think a lot of
[00:02] people who are pretty informed on how
[00:03] economies work have felt like it's
[00:05] pretty weird that the like other shoe
[00:07] has not dropped yet. We've got a
[00:09] government that feels kind of
[00:10] unpredictable. We've got tariffs, like
[00:12] big new tariffs. Also, those tariffs
[00:15] themselves feel very unpredictable. You
[00:17] got people who had previously had their
[00:19] student loans deferred no longer having
[00:21] them deferred. You got people who used
[00:22] to have government jobs no longer having
[00:24] those government jobs. But as a person
[00:26] who is really involved in the running of
[00:28] a couple of small organizations, this
[00:30] unpredictability piece of this is like a
[00:32] really big deal. It's a big cost for a
[00:34] business, especially if you're running a
[00:36] small business where you can't just like
[00:38] call up a lobbyist and get an exemption.
[00:40] You can't shift production between three
[00:42] different continents. You can't finance
[00:44] a sudden inventory pile up because
[00:46] you're worried that the rules are going
[00:47] to change next Tuesday. And so there's a
[00:49] big mystery here because markets are up.
[00:52] Jobs are not collapsing. They're like,
[00:54] "Okay, spending seems okay. People are
[00:57] still buying stuff. Online holiday
[00:58] spending in 2025 higher than ever." Now,
[01:01] the labor market has cooled. You could
[01:04] find plenty of stories about slowing,
[01:05] hiring, and rising uncertainty. But
[01:07] broadly, the story as it stands is this
[01:10] thing is still chugging along a lot more
[01:13] than people seem to have expected. So
[01:15] why? And I've heard a few explanations
[01:17] that I think are good explanations. I
[01:19] also have a hypothesis that I want to
[01:21] run by everybody that I think is
[01:24] terrifying. But we're gonna first we'll
[01:26] talk about the explanations I've heard
[01:27] that I think are pretty good. One, the
[01:29] AI investment boom. There's a lot of
[01:31] real money going into the real economy
[01:33] to build data centers and buy chips and
[01:36] power infrastructure and do the software
[01:39] and everything downstream of all of
[01:41] that. A bunch of different economic
[01:42] analysis has shown that this has been a
[01:44] big contributor to the macro situation
[01:47] in the US. It accounted for a lot of the
[01:50] private demand growth in the first half
[01:52] of 2025, latter half of 2025 probably.
[01:54] We don't have that data yet. And there's
[01:56] also like an interesting fiscal tailwind
[01:58] right now and that is in uh tax policy.
[02:02] What we are doing is we are taxing
[02:03] people less. We've lowered taxes
[02:05] especially on the wealthy and we're
[02:07] financing that through deficit spending.
[02:09] And that can keep demand high when
[02:11] things would otherwise slow down. And
[02:12] that's especially true if a lot of the
[02:15] economy the economy is propped up by
[02:18] wealthy households. The Wall Street
[02:19] Journal reported that the top 10% of
[02:21] earners drive about half of consumer
[02:24] spending because people with assets are
[02:26] doing quite well. If you had money in
[02:27] the stock market, you have a lot more
[02:29] money than you used to have. And you
[02:31] could just sell some stocks and go on
[02:32] vacation or sell some stocks and buy a
[02:33] new car. Like they have money to spend.
[02:35] So if stock prices are doing well, like
[02:37] they stay high, then high earners are
[02:39] able to keep spending and you get an
[02:40] economy that looks kind of fine in
[02:42] aggregate when a lot of small businesses
[02:45] and a lot of normal people are not
[02:47] feeling fine and all that feels like it
[02:49] makes sense to me and it tells like a
[02:50] fairly coherent story. I have an
[02:52] addition that I'd like to propose and
[02:55] this is dangerous cuz I'm just a guy and
[02:57] there's like a weaker version of this
[02:59] hypothesis that's I feel like is pretty
[03:02] true and I've actually heard it from
[03:03] other places and there's like a stronger
[03:05] version that if it is true I feel like
[03:08] is bad like really bad. So I'm going to
[03:11] tell you my little guess here and then
[03:12] I'm going to talk to an actual economist
[03:13] about whether I'm totally off the mark.
[03:15] And spoiler if I discover that there's
[03:17] nothing to this I will not release it as
[03:19] I have just recorded it. But I think
[03:21] that you should stick around for that
[03:22] conversation to see what holes we poke
[03:25] in my ideas here. So, let's start with a
[03:28] weaker claim that this is just a kind of
[03:30] political physics at work. The markets,
[03:33] we're going to talk about the markets a
[03:34] lot here, but these are human beings and
[03:36] they are broadly, we're going to talk
[03:38] about this a little later, but broadly
[03:39] fairly sympathetic to Donald Trump. They
[03:41] think that he's going to be good for
[03:43] them. And I think in part because they
[03:45] like understand the incentives here. And
[03:47] Trump, his popularity, his success is
[03:51] very much tied to the market not
[03:53] collapsing, to there not being an
[03:55] economic downturn. And so the markets,
[03:58] these people who are in charge of like
[04:00] buying and selling and sort of set a lot
[04:02] of the prices. They know that Trump will
[04:04] back off if the markets freak out. They
[04:07] know Trump won't do something. it would
[04:09] be very self-destructive for him to make
[04:12] decisions that would actually result in
[04:14] an economic downturn. And not just that,
[04:16] but that he's going to make a lot of
[04:17] decisions to make that not happen in
[04:20] whatever way he can because a lot of his
[04:22] power. You know, this is always true of
[04:24] a president, but specifically for Donald
[04:26] Trump who has a lot of his credibility
[04:28] built on him being a good businessman
[04:30] for whatever that's worth. I think that
[04:32] the markets understand that President
[04:33] Trump understands that if the economy
[04:35] turns down, it will be very bad for the
[04:37] amount of power that he has. He likes
[04:39] having power. He will do whatever he can
[04:42] to have the economy not have a downturn.
[04:44] And that includes exercising a lot of
[04:46] power that a normal president might not
[04:48] exercise, including putting a lot of
[04:50] pressure on the Fed, like doing a lot of
[04:52] things that he should not technically
[04:53] have the ability to do. Basically, if
[04:55] the president's power depends on the
[04:57] economy looking good, and if markets are
[04:59] one of the loudest and fastest feedback
[05:01] mechanisms we have, then investors can
[05:03] rationally believe that there's a limit
[05:05] to how much pain the White House will
[05:07] tolerate. And that comes straight down
[05:09] to self-interest. So, the market can
[05:12] price in a kind of back off button. And
[05:14] we saw this early on last April after
[05:17] the administration's tariff like day
[05:19] that they had, Trump uh announced a
[05:21] 90-day pause on a lot of the tariffs.
[05:24] And then the S&P 500 had its biggest
[05:26] daily gain since 2008. So that's the
[05:28] basic weaker claim that Donald Trump
[05:30] will do whatever he can to keep the
[05:32] economy humming along. And also he has
[05:34] proven to be good at exercising a lot
[05:37] more power than previous presidents. And
[05:39] so the markets believe that this very
[05:41] powerful force will continue to support
[05:43] it. I've heard a lot of people say that
[05:45] there's something happening in the
[05:46] direction of Donald Trump needs the
[05:47] economy to hold on to his power. But
[05:49] there is another portion of that cycle
[05:52] which he has a lot of power and so he
[05:55] knows he has to keep the economy going
[05:56] so he will keep the economy going and
[05:58] the markets understand that there's a
[06:00] lot of power in the administration and
[06:01] that it will work very hard to keep the
[06:03] economy going. It's a circular thing. Do
[06:05] you see how it goes both ways? Trump
[06:07] needs the economy. The economy needs
[06:09] Trump. And so one of the things that
[06:11] might be keeping the economy humming
[06:12] along is knowing that there is a strong
[06:14] man who has a great deal of power and is
[06:16] not afraid to use it and he will do
[06:18] whatever it takes to keep the economy
[06:20] humming along. And you see this in like
[06:21] little details like Trump has exemptions
[06:24] on electronics like smartphones and
[06:26] computers and semiconductors and that's
[06:28] uh like a lot of the big companies that
[06:30] are responsible for a lot of the
[06:32] increase in the market like in the S&P
[06:34] 500. So he's working hard to protect the
[06:36] things that at least make it look like
[06:37] the economy is still good. So even if
[06:39] tariffs and chaos and firing a bunch of
[06:42] government employees is bad for like the
[06:44] real economy, investors feel like
[06:46] there's a line that the administration
[06:48] won't cross and also that there's lots
[06:50] of stuff that they will do to keep
[06:51] supporting the economy because the Trump
[06:53] administration isn't going to threaten
[06:55] its own political power by letting the
[06:58] economy collapse. And that's a big buoy
[07:00] for the market. It lowers the perceived
[07:02] risk. If you feel like there is a guy
[07:04] who has a whole lot of power in charge
[07:06] of the country, he's not going to let
[07:07] that downturn happen. And he will bully
[07:09] whoever he needs to fire whoever he
[07:12] needs to even investigate whoever he
[07:14] needs to do a little bit of power that
[07:16] he shouldn't be wielding here and there
[07:18] to keep it going for his whole four
[07:21] years. I think as a model of incentives,
[07:22] especially for the kinds of people who
[07:25] are involved in finance, who tend to be
[07:29] more sort of aligned politically with
[07:31] Donald Trump and who do a lot of
[07:33] incentives-based thinking, I think that
[07:35] this makes sense that like this
[07:36] structure would result in the short term
[07:39] in a more stable economy than you would
[07:42] otherwise expect. But that is not the
[07:44] strong claim that I want to make. The
[07:45] riskier claim that I'd like to make here
[07:47] is far more worrying. But first, this
[07:49] video is brought to you by my
[07:50] newsletter. It's called We're Here. You
[07:52] get it once a week, every Friday. It
[07:54] comes in and it delivers to you some of
[07:55] the coolest things that I found from the
[07:57] internet, some introductory thoughts
[07:58] either from me or from my brother John,
[08:00] and also often a little blog post from
[08:02] the amazing people at our world in data.
[08:03] It is a human curated thing that's
[08:05] delivered to your email inbox for you to
[08:07] look at or not once a week. Check it
[08:09] out. There's a link in the description.
[08:10] It doesn't cost any money and it doesn't
[08:12] even have any advertising. I make
[08:14] negative dollars from this thing, but I
[08:16] do want people to sign up for it because
[08:18] I think that it's good. All right. Thank
[08:20] you. So, here's the strong claim. It's
[08:21] not Trump will work really hard to avoid
[08:23] a crash. And not even Trump will, you
[08:25] know, do some underhanded things to
[08:28] exercise his power in ways that might
[08:30] not technically be aligned with how the
[08:32] country is supposed to work according to
[08:33] the Constitution to keep that from
[08:36] happening. There are some really big
[08:37] companies that are responsible for a lot
[08:39] of the economy and they would like to be
[08:41] exposed to less risk and have more
[08:43] opportunity for cheaper. And what if the
[08:46] biggest companies can do relatively
[08:48] cheap things to signal loyalty and
[08:52] proximity to Trump and in return they
[08:55] get access to the levers of power and
[08:57] that access reduces their risk and
[09:00] increases their upside. This is not the
[09:02] backoff button. There's a couple words
[09:03] for this. You could call this a
[09:05] patronage system. You could call it also
[09:07] an oligarchy. And look, is this quidd
[09:09] proquo? Is this like definitely like
[09:11] written down and like say I'm bribing
[09:13] you now and then he says yes, thank you
[09:15] for your bribe. Here's your new more lax
[09:17] regulation. Like it doesn't really have
[09:19] to be that. It's a pattern. There's a
[09:22] lot of more discretionary policy.
[09:24] There's a lot of stuff that the
[09:25] administration can do or not do, enforce
[09:28] or not enforce, just depending on vibes.
[09:32] And this administration has no qualms
[09:34] about doing that. More or less from my
[09:37] perspective, depending on whether or not
[09:39] it seems like this organization of
[09:42] people has some amount of loyalty to
[09:44] Donald Trump. And in a world like that,
[09:46] very quickly the best business strategy
[09:49] becomes do that. Not like make a better
[09:52] product, not do a bunch of innovation,
[09:54] not compete on price, but just give a
[09:57] little bit of money to the
[09:58] administration. All you got to do is
[10:00] stay in favor. And for these big
[10:02] companies, this is why a lot of people I
[10:04] hear them say like, "I don't understand
[10:05] why none of these rich guys have any
[10:07] balls." Like, why aren't they pushing
[10:08] back against this? It's because if they
[10:11] don't stay in favor, their stock prices
[10:14] will go down. And they see their job as
[10:18] what their job is, which is to make the
[10:21] price go up for their investors. They
[10:22] work for their investors. They don't
[10:24] work for capitalism. They don't work for
[10:26] democracy. They don't work for ideology.
[10:29] They don't work for their customers.
[10:31] They work for the share price. And
[10:33] that's that that can be fine as long as
[10:35] making better products is the way you
[10:37] make more money. I don't think that this
[10:39] is like a paranoid fantasy. There are
[10:41] facts here. So Trump's 2025 inauguration
[10:44] fundraising was crazy. Almost $250
[10:47] million, which was corporations. It was
[10:50] ultra wealthy donors. Crypto firms alone
[10:52] gave around $18 million to the
[10:54] inauguration. But the inauguration just
[10:55] happens one time. So, how else can you
[10:57] absorb some some signals that people
[11:00] might be supportive of you and loyal to
[11:02] you? Maybe you want to build a $300
[11:04] million ballroom, but you don't want to
[11:06] use taxpayer dollars for it. So, you
[11:08] have it be private donation funding. And
[11:11] maybe this isn't even public. You have
[11:13] major corporations. You have wealthy
[11:14] individuals. You have major tech guys
[11:17] giving money to build this thing. Why
[11:19] are they doing that? Why, out of the
[11:22] goodness of their hearts, are they
[11:23] funding the construction of a ballroom?
[11:25] Do they think like, "Yeah, no, we need a
[11:27] ballroom." Is that what they're
[11:28] thinking? Now, I understand that some
[11:31] people might be thinking right now,
[11:32] "Okay, yeah, Hank, rich people and
[11:33] corporations give to political things in
[11:37] order to get sway. Welcome to America."
[11:40] But the case I'm making isn't that like
[11:41] people could spend money to get
[11:42] political capital. The case I'm making
[11:44] is very, very large companies that are
[11:47] responsible for like the majority of the
[11:48] S&P 500 are definitely like engaging in
[11:51] this. like they were sitting behind
[11:53] Donald Trump at the inauguration. They
[11:55] bought those seats. They're doing high
[11:57] visibility and high dollar shows of
[12:00] loyalty and support, but they're super
[12:02] cheap compared to like competing on
[12:04] price, right? Or like doing a bunch of
[12:06] R&D to create a new product. And they
[12:09] know that the Trump administration has
[12:10] set up an environment where policy
[12:12] outcomes are super uncertain and
[12:15] discretionary and also very
[12:18] consequential. They can have a huge
[12:20] impact on your business, but whether or
[12:21] not something actually gets enforced.
[12:24] I don't know who decides that. I'm not
[12:26] sure. It's not clear. Sometimes it does
[12:28] and sometimes it doesn't. And it's
[12:29] different for different companies. How
[12:31] do we decide? How do we decide? If
[12:32] you're a huge company that is an
[12:34] incumbent, you live in that world. All
[12:36] you need is like a shared understanding
[12:38] of the incentives here. You need to
[12:40] believe that the president rewards
[12:41] loyalty and punishes disloyalty and
[12:43] wants power. And like once you like
[12:45] believe all of those things, you can
[12:48] relatively cheaply demonstrate your
[12:50] loyalty and then suddenly we have a lot
[12:52] of really big companies that are in a
[12:54] world that has more opportunities and
[12:56] less risk and fewer threats. And that is
[12:59] an economy drifting toward an oligarchy.
[13:02] I somewhat famously among certain groups
[13:05] of people am not as critical of
[13:07] capitalism as you might expect. But I
[13:10] also understand that capitalists have no
[13:13] ideological allegiance to capitalism.
[13:15] That's not what they're doing. They're
[13:16] trying to make more money. A good
[13:18] capitalist will happily happily become
[13:21] an oligarch. Because if the other choice
[13:23] is having your competitor become the
[13:24] oligarch, THEN THAT'S TERRIBLE DECISION.
[13:26] WHY would you do that? And you can drift
[13:28] toward this oligarchy without like some
[13:30] kind of like big suitcase full of cash
[13:32] situation. It's not so much about the
[13:35] money. It's about the consolidation of
[13:36] power. It's about very large companies
[13:38] knowing that they can't cross the
[13:39] president and they have to demonstrate
[13:41] through some kind of donation that they
[13:43] are not going to be one of the ones who
[13:45] is critical of the president and the
[13:47] world of finance matters specifically
[13:50] here I think so we have seen open
[13:53] secrets did some good reporting on this
[13:56] uh described the securities and
[13:57] investment industry as a top donor
[13:59] category to Trump aligned interests and
[14:03] packs and stuff financial adviserss also
[14:05] donated way more to Trump than to
[14:06] Biden/H Harris. If you're in finances
[14:09] and you think that the game, this is not
[14:11] everybody, but if you think the game is
[14:12] political power protects asset prices,
[14:15] then supporting political power that
[14:17] just becomes risk management. And this
[14:19] is a phenomenon that in the short term
[14:21] can keep markets buoyed while the
[14:24] underlying economy is being damaged
[14:26] because the big companies that are
[14:27] responsible for all these assets that
[14:29] are still flying high and then the
[14:32] people who have assets and then the
[14:34] people who have ownership of those
[14:35] assets can sell some stock and go on a
[14:37] big vacation and stay in a fivestar
[14:38] hotel. All that money is still getting
[14:40] spent, all that economy is still
[14:42] happening. But part of the reason is
[14:44] that these big companies know that they
[14:46] can purchase stability and opportunity
[14:48] and freedom from risk. And not just
[14:50] that, but the people in the finance
[14:52] industry understand that this is a thing
[14:54] that's happening. And when you compare
[14:56] that to the antagonistic stance that a
[14:58] lot of the Biden administration had
[15:00] toward big businesses, to some people
[15:02] maybe this just seems like a
[15:04] businessfriendly environment. And so
[15:05] this is the stronger claim that I'm
[15:06] making here that there is actually a
[15:08] stabilizing force on the economy through
[15:10] this mechanism that big incumbents who
[15:13] are the majority of the economy and thus
[15:14] the majority of the asset prices and
[15:16] thus the majority of the money of the
[15:18] wealthy who are spending the majority of
[15:20] the money believe that they can get
[15:22] protection as long as they can
[15:23] demonstrate loyalty to Donald Trump.
[15:24] That reduces the downside risk for the
[15:26] big firms. Big firms dominate the index.
[15:28] The index stays strong. Assets keep
[15:30] higher earnner spending. high in
[15:32] spending props up like the average
[15:34] spending and then the average spending
[15:36] props up all of everybody's earnings and
[15:38] then the earnings prop up the index. So
[15:40] tariffs can be a drag, the
[15:41] unpredictability could be a drag,
[15:43] everything can suck for small
[15:44] businesses. Everything can suck for the
[15:46] lower and middle class, but the market
[15:49] can still float up there because the
[15:52] market is betting that the winners will
[15:53] be protected and the losers will be
[15:56] everybody else. But the winners will be
[15:58] protected and they're the ones that take
[15:59] up so much of the economy anyway. Now, I
[16:01] assume that we all understand that if
[16:02] we're pretty far over on the spectrum,
[16:05] the short-term stability in the market
[16:07] does not mean like long-term good
[16:11] outcomes. The cost of this, we've seen
[16:14] it in lots of different countries is
[16:16] brutal. Any economy where impress the
[16:18] dictator beats build a better product is
[16:20] not a competitive economy. It's not one
[16:23] that generates a lot of good stuff. It
[16:25] stops serving consumers. It becomes
[16:27] purely extractive. it becomes all about
[16:29] rent seeking. It's all about how much
[16:31] can we pull out of people. And this is
[16:33] not unusual. It's just that we don't
[16:34] usually see it in such fine grain detail
[16:37] where we don't see that like early on
[16:39] it's not bad for the economy for stuff
[16:41] like this to happen. But it takes a
[16:43] while before you see the effect of the
[16:45] innovation slowing. It takes a while
[16:47] before you see the effect of upstarts
[16:49] not being able to break in. It takes a
[16:50] while before you see the effects of all
[16:52] this capital and talent getting wasted
[16:54] on the influence part of everything and
[16:57] not on the actual creation of of
[17:00] product. But eventually that place
[17:03] becomes not dynamic. It becomes less
[17:06] resilient, less capable of real growth.
[17:08] And there's like a reason why corruption
[17:09] is bad. Like it's it's not just like a a
[17:12] morality thing. It's bad for a society.
[17:14] Like there's a bunch of reasons. I just
[17:16] get over and over again I start to like
[17:18] get this sense that that we've forgotten
[17:20] that there's reasons why we don't like
[17:22] things. It's just like oh well yeah we
[17:24] like say that this is bad but when I
[17:26] like my guy's doing it's kind of okay.
[17:28] There's reasons why the bad things are
[17:29] bad. They hurt systems. They stop things
[17:33] from working. Corruption is the biggest
[17:35] kind of theft. It is the largest scale
[17:38] society scale theft and it is all about
[17:41] giving the powerful power to extract
[17:44] rent from the unpowerful which is what
[17:46] everybody says is like the terrible
[17:47] thing about capitalism and like yeah but
[17:49] that's not a symptom of a well
[17:50] functioning market in a good market you
[17:53] move to somebody who's less extractive
[17:54] that's why there are certain things like
[17:56] housing and healthcare that maybe
[17:57] shouldn't be purely market driven and so
[17:59] I think this is like worth taking
[18:00] seriously and I'm certainly not the
[18:02] first person to identify that like we're
[18:03] sliding into an oligarchy but the fact
[18:05] that it might help explain this weird
[18:07] phenomenon where we have a bunch of new
[18:08] frictions in the economy, but the
[18:10] economy is still doing well. I haven't
[18:11] seen anybody say that. And like maybe
[18:13] I'm wrong. Like I don't follow things
[18:15] that close. But even the weak version,
[18:16] like the backoff button is already
[18:18] enough to distort a bunch of incentives
[18:20] here. The strong version, however far we
[18:23] are along that spectrum, the like
[18:24] loyalty for protection version, that's
[18:26] how you build a country where the market
[18:27] is not a competition to serve people. It
[18:29] is a competition to serve power and use
[18:31] that to suck resources out of people.
[18:34] And I think a lot of people do really
[18:35] think that that's like a normal thing to
[18:37] do. Like as long as you can do it, do
[18:39] it. That's what capitalism is. No, it's
[18:41] not. That's oligarchy. And you could do
[18:42] that in a communist system. You could do
[18:43] it in a capitalist system. You can give
[18:45] a lot of people the power to control the
[18:48] levers and then extract everything out
[18:50] of people. And what you find in that
[18:52] system is that it sucks. I was going to
[18:54] say that it sucks all the energy and
[18:56] competitiveness out of economy, but like
[18:57] let's just end it there. It sucks.
[18:59] Places where this happens do not have a
[19:00] bunch of people thriving in the middle
[19:02] class. But now I really have gotten to
[19:03] the point where I feel like I'm talking
[19:04] out of my ass. So, I'd like to talk to
[19:06] an economist, somebody who thinks a lot
[19:08] about the weird and messy time that we
[19:11] are in in America and who I enjoy uh
[19:14] hearing from and learning from. So, I'm
[19:17] going to publish this video as I just
[19:19] recorded it. I'm going to edit it up.
[19:21] I'm going to send it to Kylo Scandlin
[19:22] and then hopefully we're going to cut
[19:25] and I will be having a conversation.
[19:27] Everybody, theoretically, this is Kylo
[19:29] Scandlin. I think you have essentially
[19:31] covered what a lot of the major
[19:34] financial outlets have been talking
[19:35] about. Even in the first week of
[19:36] February, uh Ken Griffin of Citadel came
[19:39] out and essentially said what you were
[19:41] saying where he's like, "I'm really
[19:43] worried that the economy is bending a
[19:46] knee to the Trump family. They've really
[19:48] enriched themselves." So the fact that
[19:50] somebody of that stature and somebody of
[19:52] that level of power is coming out and
[19:55] saying like, "Hey, it seems like there's
[19:57] some level of oligarchy going on, you're
[20:00] correct in your statement." Yeah,
[20:02] >> I feel like the weak case is pretty
[20:03] clear. The Trump administration
[20:06] desperately wants and needs the economy
[20:08] or at least the stock market to keep
[20:09] chugging along and
[20:11] >> the the highest spenders and highest
[20:14] earners and highest wealth individuals
[20:15] will continue to spend and and that will
[20:18] keep some portion of the economy
[20:20] chugging along. I don't have confidence
[20:21] that Trump could really make the stock
[20:23] market go up, but I have confidence that
[20:24] he could make it go down because I've
[20:26] seen him do it.
[20:27] >> He does. Yeah.
[20:27] >> And then when that happens, he's like,
[20:29] "Never mind." actually uh three three
[20:32] points of stock market loss is actually
[20:34] way too much for me. Uh let's let's keep
[20:36] the thing going. So I think that that's
[20:37] very clear. But the part where maybe the
[20:40] economy is benefiting or like the
[20:42] biggest companies in the economy like is
[20:46] there some portion of the finance
[20:47] industry that's like these companies
[20:49] will be fine because
[20:52] like they'll they have made it clear
[20:54] that they will bend the knee and that
[20:55] Trump will reward them for that. I mean,
[20:57] I think some of them are struggling. So,
[21:00] the Trump administration took a large
[21:02] percentage of Intel. Intel's stock went
[21:05] up on the news and has since suffered
[21:07] quite a bit.
[21:08] >> So, I don't think it's like a guarantee
[21:09] that if you do a big deal with Trump
[21:11] that you're going to be free sailing,
[21:14] >> but he has made it very much an easy
[21:17] environment for the AI companies to
[21:20] succeed. And that's such a big
[21:22] percentage of the economy. Like it's
[21:23] like 40% of GDP growth last year, you
[21:26] know, 75% of S&P 500's earnings. So like
[21:29] the stock market, it's like driving so
[21:31] much stock market growth. And so I think
[21:33] there is this assumption if you're a
[21:34] technology company and you get along
[21:37] well with the Trump administration,
[21:38] you'll be free from some regulation. And
[21:41] that's why you saw all of the big tech
[21:44] tech leaders um at his inauguration.
[21:47] It's why Jeff Bezos did the Millennia
[21:49] movie for millions and millions of
[21:51] dollars and then turned around and fired
[21:53] 30% of Washington Post staff. Um there
[21:57] there's this idea that yeah, if you get
[22:00] in the correct way and you're a tech
[22:01] company, you'll be relatively safe. And
[22:04] I think that's the only people that they
[22:05] can really promise it to. Like there's
[22:07] been a big push in the Trump
[22:09] administration for manufacturing, but
[22:11] manufacturing has enormously suffered
[22:14] underneath uh Trump because of the
[22:16] tariffs. So, it's really only tech and
[22:18] that's kind of okay in their eyes
[22:20] because tech is such a big part of the
[22:22] economy.
[22:22] >> Is it mostly a big part of the stock
[22:25] market or is it a big part of the
[22:27] economy?
[22:28] >> It's a big part of GDP growth. So, it's
[22:30] a big part of the economy and what the
[22:32] economy is based on.
[22:33] >> Yeah. Yes. And uh it's where a lot of
[22:36] financing is going. So data center bonds
[22:39] are a huge part of uh the bond market
[22:42] currently and AI companies are taken out
[22:44] a ton of debt which is usually a little
[22:46] bit of a red flag. Um and uh yeah so
[22:50] it's a big part of the economy in terms
[22:52] of growth but not a big a part of the
[22:53] economy in terms of jobs. So like most
[22:56] jobs being added are in healthcare and
[22:58] social services which do not get the
[23:00] same sort of investment that AI is
[23:02] getting. Yeah. in part because like all
[23:04] of that's you know relatively relatively
[23:07] low margin um in the long term because
[23:10] you because of the the people because of
[23:12] the jobs and if you have to pay a bunch
[23:14] of people to do the work then uh you
[23:16] know that that costs money and as
[23:18] people's salaries go up that costs more
[23:20] money and that's all stuff that we want
[23:21] but it cuts into the
[23:22] >> cuts into the margin
[23:24] >> whereas the tech industry traditionally
[23:27] even before AI has been
[23:30] >> like tremendously
[23:32] like worldshakingly different in terms
[23:35] of the number of jobs created per the
[23:37] number of dollars created.
[23:39] >> So like far fewer jobs per number of
[23:41] dollars made. But then AI is like a
[23:43] whole another level of that where it's
[23:44] like well maybe the the software can do
[23:47] all of the jobs which is maybe not
[23:50] entirely untrue. I think there's
[23:51] actually a lot of jobs that will be done
[23:53] by AI.
[23:54] >> Yeah, that's a big scare in the market
[23:56] right now. Anthropic, which is one of
[23:58] the top AI labs, released this like
[24:00] legal AI assistant and the stock market
[24:03] had a pretty big sell-off across the
[24:05] software companies because everyone was
[24:07] like, "Oh my gosh, if they can make this
[24:09] legal assistant, they can make any
[24:10] software obsolete." Which I think is a
[24:12] little bit overstated. But what was also
[24:15] interesting about that is all of the
[24:16] major asset managers sold off because
[24:18] private equity and private credit have
[24:20] so much exposure to software. Uh and
[24:24] that really complicates where the stock
[24:26] market has to go and software
[24:28] maintaining it's very high valuation.
[24:30] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So all these these
[24:32] software as a service companies that you
[24:33] never hear about. You have no idea they
[24:35] exist. Private equity is very exposed to
[24:37] them and they are very big
[24:39] >> and so are regular investors. There's
[24:41] something called business development
[24:42] companies. Private equity has or private
[24:45] credit has rolled up to allow mom and
[24:47] pop investors to get some exposure to
[24:50] junk bonds. Um and that's complicated.
[24:52] Yeah. Yeah, it's it's getting like
[24:55] really spooky.
[24:56] >> I have this sense, and correct me if I'm
[24:57] wrong, that there's a lot of money out
[24:59] there.
[25:00] >> There's a lot of money.
[25:01] >> So like Apple has a lot of money. Warren
[25:03] Buffett is sitting on a big pile of
[25:05] cash. I think that there's a lot of
[25:08] high netw worth folks who who have money
[25:11] and they're not sure what to invest it
[25:13] in. And for a second there, it was like
[25:15] everybody's got to get into the AI.
[25:17] >> But now you're saying AI companies are
[25:18] taking on debt. And that to me indicates
[25:20] that they can't sell their just shares
[25:24] for super expensive and and raise that
[25:26] money that way.
[25:26] >> Their valuations are pretty inflated. Um
[25:29] so they're turned into the debt market.
[25:31] >> They've already gotten about as high as
[25:33] it's gone about as far as it can go as
[25:35] they say.
[25:35] >> Um it's pretty in it's pretty high.
[25:37] Yeah.
[25:40] the question I I keep noodling on and so
[25:43] every time something I'm like anchored
[25:46] to it right now and so every time like
[25:47] something comes along I'm like does this
[25:49] explain my question but the question is
[25:51] just like why is the economy still going
[25:54] hot? It seems like it like seems like
[25:56] things are fine and I don't I don't mean
[25:58] the stock market like I went to the mall
[25:59] this weekend and the mall was full of
[26:01] people shopping and and going to the
[26:03] arcade. Like the arcade where my son
[26:05] loves to go was it was sweaty in there.
[26:08] There was so many people running around.
[26:10] I was like, I gotta leave. I feel like
[26:12] I'm leaving in here. It's very hard to
[26:14] tell when you're on the internet because
[26:15] of course the internet story is always
[26:17] going to be the scariest story. Nobody's
[26:20] going to talk about how they're doing
[26:21] well. That's not going to be, you know,
[26:23] fun to say. Yes.
[26:25] >> For one, because like there's always
[26:26] going to there's always people who are
[26:27] not doing well.
[26:29] >> Um, and so like you we're somewhat
[26:31] dependent on government data. we're
[26:32] somewhat dependent on, you know, lots of
[26:34] analysts doing analyst stuff to figure
[26:36] out if things are going okay. Does it
[26:38] seem like things are going okay?
[26:40] >> I mean, I've been studying this uh
[26:42] phenomenon of the sort of the disconnect
[26:44] between consumer sentiment, so how
[26:46] people are saying that they feel and
[26:47] then broad economic data for a long time
[26:50] because people will say that they're
[26:51] feeling really bad, but they'll go out
[26:53] and spend. Like retail spending is up,
[26:56] you know, consumer credit, people are
[26:58] using their credit cards actively.
[27:00] They're spending money on all sorts of
[27:02] things. We're seeing them spend a lot
[27:03] more on, you know, like food, groceries,
[27:06] uh, rent versus maybe clothes. Right
[27:09] now, the economy is pretty substantially
[27:12] weakening. But the United States has a
[27:16] lot of access to credit and so people
[27:19] have a lot of access to credit. And so I
[27:21] think the theory that a lot of people
[27:23] will float with the strength in the
[27:25] economy is that people are able to use
[27:27] their credit cards, able to use products
[27:29] like CLA which um allow you to pay in
[27:32] installments. But then also um a lot of
[27:35] the spending and a lot of the growth
[27:37] outside of the anecdotes is from higher
[27:39] income consumers. So 10% of Americans,
[27:42] the top 10 top 10% wealthiest drive, you
[27:46] know, over half of of consumer spending.
[27:48] And so that is also keeping the economy
[27:50] afloat and ties into your asset price
[27:53] theory where you know everybody's assets
[27:55] have exploded in value over the past
[27:57] couple of years if you own a home if you
[27:59] own tech stocks. So people are wealthy
[28:02] um because of that and so they're able
[28:03] to go and spend money in that way and so
[28:06] that does provide a floor to the economy
[28:08] right now. Does that answer your
[28:10] question?
[28:10] >> Oh it gives me great context. Yes. I
[28:13] don't think there's an answer to it, but
[28:14] I guess it does feel like the greatest
[28:17] trick the devil ever pulled was was
[28:19] tying absolutely everything to the price
[28:21] of these of of the stock market. You
[28:24] know, this is like let's have
[28:25] everybody's retirements be based on
[28:26] that. Let's let's have everybody's
[28:29] >> let's have the entire economy be based
[28:31] on 10% of wealthy people feeling like
[28:33] they can spend whatever on whatever.
[28:35] Does that feel like the Achilles heel
[28:37] right now? like if asset prices drop
[28:40] substantially, people suddenly get
[28:42] conservative and that becomes a
[28:43] reinforcing loop.
[28:44] >> I think that's a worry. Yeah, I think
[28:46] that's a big worry is that if the stock
[28:49] market does drop, um, you know, a lot of
[28:51] people's wealth doesn't come from labor
[28:54] income anymore. It comes from owning
[28:56] stocks or owning a home. Um, the Federal
[28:58] Reserve has a pretty good wealth
[29:00] breakdown on their website and they show
[29:02] this like for the top 10% most of their
[29:04] wealth is coming from things that they
[29:06] own or businesses that they own, not
[29:08] from like money that they're making
[29:09] through a job. Um, so the whole like
[29:13] wealth effect is is important to
[29:15] maintaining the economy which comes from
[29:17] these high asset prices. Uh and so if
[29:20] the stock market does go down or
[29:22] experience a correction, there is a a
[29:25] concern that yes, people would stop
[29:27] spending and it would cause a pretty big
[29:30] contraction in the economy. There's
[29:32] something called a K-shaped economy. So
[29:33] in some parts of the economy, this is
[29:36] already happening. So for lower income
[29:37] consumers are having a harder time, you
[29:40] know, living paycheck to paycheck. Their
[29:42] wages have not grown nearly as much as
[29:44] higher income consumers. Um they don't
[29:47] own the same assets. they're not as
[29:49] likely to own a house because we don't
[29:50] build enough housing. They're already
[29:52] kind of in a recession type environment.
[29:55] Whereas wealthier consumers are more
[29:57] insulated because of the hot asset
[29:58] prices.
[29:59] >> What do I know?
[30:00] >> But it just seemed to be like there's
[30:02] there's like a whole lot of there's a
[30:04] lot of weaknesses. Like there's a lot of
[30:05] weak points. It doesn't seem rational to
[30:08] me. Like the the sort of like shape of
[30:10] the economy doesn't in a way that like
[30:13] economies I know that the economists say
[30:15] this. They're like supposed to be
[30:17] rational. Like there's supposed to be
[30:18] this system, this like series of like
[30:22] people acting in their self-interests
[30:23] and and making decisions that make
[30:25] sense. But like I mean if we just like
[30:28] pick micro examples, it's very easy to
[30:30] say that there are not like like super
[30:32] irrational things out there. And this
[30:35] has been the case for I don't know when
[30:36] the sort of meme stock phenomenon began,
[30:38] but it's it seemed like for quite a
[30:40] while where we're just sort of like
[30:42] yeah, the thing that you have to
[30:43] understand about Tesla is that it's not
[30:45] about Tesla. It's about everyone
[30:48] thinking the price of Tesla is going to
[30:50] go up
[30:51] >> because they think that people are going
[30:53] to buy more Tesla. Not about the value,
[30:56] not about the like delivered, not really
[30:58] about optimist or whatever. It's about
[31:01] It's about like the vibes around the
[31:05] stock. And
[31:07] >> yeah,
[31:07] >> and there's like if that can be that way
[31:09] for one of the most valuable companies
[31:11] in the stock market, like we're not
[31:14] talking about GameStop here. There's a
[31:15] huge amount of value tied up in in
[31:17] there. It and it does seem very Ponzi to
[31:19] me. It seems like, well, you have to buy
[31:21] it because it's going to go up and it's
[31:23] going to go up because you have to buy
[31:24] it.
[31:24] >> I mean, you could argue the same thing
[31:26] for crypto and this idea. Have you heard
[31:28] of reflexivity? Have you heard of that
[31:29] word?
[31:30] >> No.
[31:31] >> So that's a concept that George Soros
[31:33] coined in the latter half of the 1900s.
[31:36] And it was essentially that idea that
[31:38] people would believe something is going
[31:40] to happen. So they'd go and buy up
[31:42] whatever they thought was going to
[31:43] happen. So stock going up and then that
[31:45] would cause the stock price to go up. So
[31:46] it's essentially that idea. Yeah. It's
[31:49] the bubble mentality, you know. Um and
[31:52] so it's just it's a very human.
[31:53] >> It's the bubble mentality, but Tesla has
[31:55] been this way for a long time. Bubbles
[31:57] can last a long time.
[31:58] >> I don't like that.
[32:00] >> I mean, they can last as long as as
[32:02] frustrating because I want to I want to
[32:04] buy at the top. Kyla,
[32:06] >> you want to buy at the bottom? Oh, I
[32:07] know. I want to sell at the top. Sorry.
[32:10] >> Want to do the opposite.
[32:10] >> I want to make no money
[32:14] >> cuz I because I want to know when the
[32:16] bubble's going to pop so that I can buy
[32:18] puts or options or whatever the thing is
[32:20] that you make money when things go down.
[32:21] >> Well, well, then you get into canes,
[32:23] right? markets can stay irrational
[32:25] longer than you can stay solvent. Um,
[32:27] that's
[32:27] >> Oh, that's a that's an important John
[32:29] Mayor. I should tattoo that on the
[32:30] inside of my eyelids. Yeah,
[32:32] >> it's a good one. Yeah. Um, so that's the
[32:34] other funny thing is like economists and
[32:37] market analysts have been talking about
[32:38] these ideas forever, but because there
[32:41] is so much access, which is both a good
[32:43] and bad thing, like you can buy whatever
[32:44] you want on Robin Hood, there's much
[32:47] more exposure to bubbles and everybody
[32:49] can participate in one. You know, crypto
[32:51] has proven itself, I think, to be a
[32:54] bubble in some aspects of the products
[32:56] that it offers, like Fartcoin. Um, and
[33:00] yeah,
[33:00] >> Fartcoin.
[33:02] >> Oh, you haven't heard of fartcoin?
[33:04] Are you really? Oh, no.
[33:10] >> I'm sorry.
[33:10] >> Sorry. I I find I find myself watching
[33:13] too many videos about astrophysics. I
[33:15] guess
[33:15] >> that's much better for your brain. Yeah.
[33:17] Bitcoin was this it was actually a top
[33:20] performing asset last year. Um
[33:24] >> is it continued to be this year or has
[33:26] >> no the big selloff the bubble popped.
[33:28] Yeah.
[33:28] >> The fart bubble popped.
[33:30] >> Exactly. Uh but there's a lot of stuff
[33:32] like that. Like these things that'll
[33:34] happen and then everybody will pile into
[33:36] it. Trumpcoin is kind of another example
[33:38] too. Even though that ended up being a
[33:40] way for people to skirt the legal system
[33:42] and to pay him bribes to get out of jail
[33:45] like Justin's son did using Trumpcoin as
[33:47] a way to
[33:48] >> I just Yeah. I mean that also I have a
[33:50] theory that we forgot why corruption is
[33:54] bad because we were too focused on the
[33:56] fact that that corruption is bad. Yeah.
[33:58] >> Um and and I think that this is true of
[34:01] a lot of different things in society
[34:02] where we talk about why like thing bad
[34:05] but we we we've talked about it being
[34:07] bad for so long
[34:08] >> that we that we lost touch with the the
[34:11] why behind it. And corruption is a good
[34:14] example of this where we're kind of just
[34:15] like well yeah you know like ultimately
[34:18] we kind of hired a guy who's you know a
[34:21] a wheeler and a dealer and like
[34:22] corruption is going to be like a little
[34:24] part of that. But like corruption is bad
[34:26] for like a reason which is that it is
[34:28] stealing from everyone else
[34:30] >> and other countries.
[34:32] >> Corruption is like stealing from
[34:33] everyone who's not involved in the
[34:35] corruption.
[34:36] >> Uhhuh. From
[34:38] >> and that of course like leads to an
[34:40] eventual like corrosion of trust in all
[34:42] institutions which of course has has
[34:44] been going on for a while.
[34:45] >> Well, if you think about the thing
[34:47] that's backing the US dollar, it's full
[34:49] faith and credit in the American
[34:51] institution. And a big part of that what
[34:55] the big part of that is
[34:57] >> I don't like I really don't want that to
[34:58] be the Achilles heel.
[34:59] >> Oh sorry the dollar where no the the
[35:03] American institution which of course it
[35:05] is but I want it to be a wellshielded
[35:06] Achilles heel you know that has that
[35:09] isn't weak.
[35:10] >> Should be it should be it was designed
[35:12] to not be weak.
[35:12] >> It seemed impervious until 10 years ago.
[35:17] >> I know. Yeah. I mean, if you
[35:20] >> Now, now it feels like there's like like
[35:22] there's arrows from every direction
[35:23] headed toward this little this little
[35:25] boy and and maybe the shields the
[35:28] shields are not as strong as they as we
[35:30] thought they were.
[35:30] >> Yeah. I mean, they're auxiliary
[35:32] institutions is what James Madison
[35:33] called it. Like this idea that we would
[35:35] have all of these protection points, the
[35:37] Supreme Court, Congress, um as a way to
[35:40] prevent a strong man from coming in. And
[35:42] like the founders knew something like
[35:44] this would happen one day. They knew
[35:45] that there would be a personality that
[35:47] could take over through the power of
[35:49] power of whatever he has and they
[35:52] designed it so that there would be
[35:54] institutions that would hopefully stop
[35:55] it. But um you know objectively the
[35:58] institutions um seem to be quite
[36:01] complacent. now they can just sort of
[36:03] throw insults rather than addressing
[36:06] like real questions that people have
[36:08] about why things are functioning the way
[36:10] that they do and it it creates a very uh
[36:13] toxic media environment where there is
[36:16] incentive
[36:17] >> to lie um everything is yeah run by
[36:21] reality TV show
[36:22] >> the the this is a big thing that I'm
[36:25] trying to make a long video about and it
[36:27] just keeps getting out of hand um the
[36:30] size of the video it may turn into
[36:31] several videos, which is annoying
[36:34] >> because then then they're
[36:36] >> they get put on the back burner and it's
[36:38] important, but um that is something I
[36:40] actually feel qualified to talk on is
[36:42] sort of like the the structure of how
[36:45] information flows because that's my job,
[36:47] you know, like how do I get attention on
[36:49] ideas? How do I get attention on
[36:51] >> fish evolution
[36:53] or
[36:54] you know we the weird economy of the
[36:57] Trump era? I want to since let's let's
[36:58] get back on a little more of your area
[37:00] of expertise to finish up. If you could
[37:03] give me like the three leading reasons
[37:07] because of course we'll never get to the
[37:08] bottom of exactly what's going on. Um
[37:10] maybe in hindsight we'll have some idea,
[37:12] but three leading reasons why the
[37:14] economy appears to be chugging along
[37:16] just fine right now.
[37:17] >> What would you call those three leading
[37:19] reasons?
[37:20] >> I mean I think there's the wealth
[37:21] effect. So you have asset prices that
[37:23] have skyrocketed. Um, so a lot of people
[37:26] have really benefited from the stock
[37:28] market boom. And then I think that also
[37:31] ties into housing. Um, so boomers have
[37:34] an extraordinary amount of wealth. Uh,
[37:37] and they're willing,
[37:38] >> which is why Donald Trump is out here
[37:40] being like, we can't make the house
[37:42] prices go down.
[37:43] >> We can't.
[37:44] >> People worked like not for these people
[37:46] who aren't working very hard.
[37:48] >> No.
[37:48] >> So that people who don't work very hard
[37:50] can have a house.
[37:51] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[37:51] >> It's like you don't think you who's not
[37:53] working very hard right now, buddy.
[37:55] >> Oh my gosh. And then who are they going
[37:56] to sell it to cuz you people won't be
[37:59] able to afford that. Yeah.
[38:02] >> Um so I think that's a big part of it.
[38:05] And then um the AI trade I think is
[38:08] providing like a floor to the market and
[38:10] therefore a floor to the economy. Data
[38:12] center spending um services spending. So
[38:16] that's creating a lot of uh economic
[38:19] power. And then I I think the third
[38:21] thing is uh
[38:26] maybe a part of it is that there is that
[38:31] availability of credit. So people have
[38:34] access to things like CLA. They're able
[38:37] to take out things on their credit
[38:38] cards. Um
[38:40] >> there's just new credit tools.
[38:42] >> There's a lot of Yeah. And so some
[38:44] people are getting a little overextended
[38:45] and we're starting to see that in the
[38:47] data especially with auto loans. Um but
[38:50] yeah, so those are the three things kind
[38:52] of froen things up right now. Yeah,
[38:55] >> those don't seem like particularly solid
[38:57] pillars.
[38:58] >> No, I mean ideally people would be able
[39:00] to, you know, buy a house with their
[39:02] labor income and then ideally the whole
[39:05] 401k business wouldn't be just entirely
[39:07] tied up into like people would have a
[39:09] different way to retire. So it's not
[39:11] inflating the stock market in the way
[39:13] that it is now and we'd have investment
[39:16] diversification outside of AI. I mean, I
[39:18] just worry about how many resources
[39:20] we're funneling toward this one thing.
[39:22] And we don't even know if we'll need
[39:23] data centers. Like it might evolve to
[39:25] the point where the things are so
[39:27] efficient that they don't need these
[39:28] huge structures.
[39:29] >> Things things could get more like that's
[39:31] tends to be how it goes. But yeah,
[39:33] >> these big companies have the money to
[39:34] spend. Like Google's like, "Oh, finally
[39:36] something to spend money on."
[39:37] >> Yeah,
[39:38] >> we have lots of that. If we can win just
[39:40] by having money, that would be a huge
[39:42] that would be huge for us because we
[39:44] could we can have money and we know how
[39:45] to build data centers. Um, and then you
[39:48] know these the startups I think will
[39:51] have a hard time competing in that
[39:52] environment. But you know the opening
[39:54] eyes and the anthropics but um but I
[39:57] think also like the more money that they
[39:59] spend the more
[40:01] >> valuable their companies are like the
[40:03] more the more it's all about money the
[40:05] the more it's all about money.
[40:07] >> Yeah. But there's some drama going on
[40:08] because of the circular financing. So
[40:10] OpenAI and Nvidia aren't getting along
[40:13] so well right now. Yeah.
[40:14] >> Yeah. And suddenly Oracle's like, I
[40:16] didn't promise anything.
[40:16] >> That was so funny.
[40:18] >> My shirt answers the question you're
[40:20] asking type thing. Why would you tweet
[40:23] that? Like what a red flag. They were
[40:25] like, uh, everything's fine.
[40:27] >> Did that that come out of nowhere? Was
[40:29] were they not asking?
[40:30] >> No, they they essentially like started
[40:32] this whole domino effect and they were
[40:34] like, everything's fine. And then
[40:36] everyone was like, "Surely nothing's
[40:37] fine if Oracle is like saying that."
[40:41] >> But it sounds like you wouldn't put like
[40:43] uh everybody feels like Donald Trump
[40:46] will keep the economy rolling whatever
[40:48] the cost as as one of the pillars here.
[40:51] >> He'll keep the stock market rolling
[40:54] whatever the cost. Yeah. And that's not
[40:55] always reliant on the economy doing
[40:58] well.
[40:59] >> Sure. But you think that that is a thing
[41:01] that that like pe that like some people
[41:03] in the world of finance are relying on
[41:05] Donald Trump uh being like a ruthless
[41:08] will keep the stock market up no matter
[41:09] what kind of kind of
[41:10] >> Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Um and I think
[41:13] they're getting sick of it like the taco
[41:15] stuff. Trump always chickens out so
[41:17] he'll like announce these major tariffs.
[41:18] The stock market will sell off. Um I
[41:21] don't know how much more power he'll
[41:22] have in that stance. Um, and
[41:26] >> you think you might have burned a lot of
[41:27] that ability,
[41:28] >> especially internationally, you know, if
[41:30] the EU doesn't want to buy treasuries,
[41:33] uh, we're in trouble. They own 40% of US
[41:36] treasuries. Uh, so,
[41:38] >> and that's treasuries being a way that
[41:40] we fund our national
[41:42] >> finance. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. The main way
[41:43] that we fund all of the spending that
[41:45] the US does. So, if the US can't fund
[41:48] all this spending, you know, the
[41:50] government
[41:50] >> or has to pay a higher interest rate to
[41:52] fund it,
[41:53] >> right? Exactly. Um, and then that's not
[41:55] good either. Uh, so I think everyone's
[41:58] like, "This doesn't really make sense."
[42:00] And I think Ken Griffin from Citadel is
[42:03] the canary in the coal mine there.
[42:04] >> This is dumb for me to ask at the end
[42:07] here, but is the are the tax breaks a
[42:09] part of this? Like, are rich people just
[42:10] able to spend more because they have
[42:11] more because the tax breaks?
[42:13] >> Yeah. Yeah. And they I mean, they're
[42:14] pretty successful at bending the tax law
[42:17] to their already. Yeah.
[42:19] >> But yes. Yeah. Fewer taxes spend.
[42:22] >> Well, yeah. I mean, what I'll say is
[42:23] like as a high earnner who also has a
[42:26] high net worth, like the earnings,
[42:30] they get taxed a lot and and like that's
[42:33] fine, but like I what I see is that the
[42:35] money that comes from my investments
[42:37] doesn't
[42:38] >> get taxed a lot and and so like I don't
[42:41] know. I I've I've asked seemingly
[42:44] progressive billionaires about this and
[42:46] I'm like why why do I pay so much like
[42:50] lower taxes on money I don't work for
[42:54] >> and they're like they're like the risk
[42:56] and I'm like also labor is a risk. What
[42:59] the are you talking about? Like like
[43:01] choosing what company to work for is a
[43:03] risk. Companies go out of business. They
[43:05] sometimes they treat you terribly. Like
[43:06] you invest a lot in them and then they
[43:08] can just lay you off. Like it's a it's a
[43:10] r like risk everywhere, not just for you
[43:12] rich man.
[43:13] >> There's lots of risk. And so like labor
[43:15] is also risk. I don't understand like
[43:18] the idea that capital gains should be
[43:19] taxed at a lower rate. I like may maybe
[43:22] there there's like some argument there
[43:24] that I don't get. But man
[43:27] >> man like am I being incentivized to stop
[43:30] creating value and instead just sit
[43:32] there and look at Robin Hood all day?
[43:34] >> Yes, you are. There was a a good article
[43:36] in the FT that said that we have become
[43:39] a place of shareholder rights over civic
[43:42] rights. And I think that the taxation
[43:45] system encapsulates that well.
[43:47] >> Well, that makes me mad.
[43:49] >> Yeah. I mean, it's just it's like by
[43:52] design. Um, and so it's not great. It
[43:56] doesn't incentivize the right things,
[43:58] especially right now with all the
[43:59] financial nihilism and people not
[44:01] trusting that getting a job will do them
[44:03] any good. So they just go and sports
[44:05] gamble and do production markets and
[44:07] stuff. Yeah.
[44:07] >> Well, I didn't mean to get in on that
[44:09] sad note.
[44:10] >> It's it's kind of like every lane you go
[44:13] down, there's some some sad note these
[44:16] days, but I have a lot of hope. I'm I'm
[44:18] hopeful like
[44:19] >> Well, then get me with that. Where where
[44:21] is do you feel your hope comes from?
[44:23] >> I just I mean I've been traveling the
[44:25] country for the past year with my book
[44:26] and uh you know I meet people in all
[44:28] these cities and I meet people who are
[44:30] working really hard on these problems
[44:31] that we're talking about. like how do
[44:33] you make a better world? And a lot of
[44:34] that does happen at the local level
[44:36] right now. Like we focus a lot on the
[44:38] federal problems in the news because
[44:40] they are so big, but what people are
[44:42] doing in local communities is like very
[44:44] important and very impressive and you
[44:46] just have to believe in in those people
[44:48] right now and that they'll pull us
[44:50] through. what I'll say to people uh and
[44:53] and like I know I'm talking from a place
[44:56] of just a huge amount of privilege here
[44:58] um but the uh I do think that like and
[45:04] maybe this message is more for the rich
[45:06] people than it like so if if you have
[45:08] more money than average hear this like I
[45:11] think that it is much more interesting
[45:13] to be out here making value than out
[45:16] here like moving dollars around so if
[45:19] there's like ways for you to be in in
[45:21] the mix. Be in the mix. And also, if
[45:24] there's ways for your money to be in the
[45:25] mix, instead of just sitting in your
[45:27] accounts, if it's like out there doing
[45:29] good, try and figure out how to get it
[45:31] out there doing good. Pick a number,
[45:33] figure out where that is, and then get
[45:35] the rest of it out there doing good
[45:36] because it's doing nothing sitting in
[45:39] your accounts. It's doing nothing
[45:40] propping up a stock market that's
[45:42] already overvalued. just get it out and
[45:44] like like there's so much good that can
[45:46] be done out there and like figure that
[45:48] out in your local community
[45:50] internationally, nationally, wherever.
[45:52] >> There's a lot of lessons to learn from
[45:53] the Robert Barons like Carnegie.
[45:55] >> There's a lot of lessons to learn from
[45:56] the robber barons
[45:58] >> like libraries and they just they spent
[46:00] their money in a much different way
[46:02] because they knew like Henry Ford with
[46:04] all his problems he knew that if he had
[46:06] happy workers he would have a happy
[46:08] company and he'd make a more successful
[46:09] product. Obviously, he had his own
[46:11] complications, but like they just
[46:13] thought about the relationship between
[46:15] uh employer and employee and rich person
[46:18] and community a lot differently and they
[46:20] saw the connections and the ties and
[46:22] what they could do to build that up.
[46:24] Yeah. To have better business in the
[46:25] end. This makes all of us better off.
[46:28] >> Yeah. No. Yeah. And I I like I just feel
[46:31] like uh there's a lot of people who have
[46:32] like enough money to start up a little
[46:34] business doing something interesting and
[46:35] that would create value and that would
[46:36] make them a little bit of money, but
[46:37] they can make so much more money
[46:39] investing in a REIT or in private
[46:42] equity. And so that's what they do. They
[46:44] let somebody like outsource all of the
[46:46] of the work of running a company, the
[46:48] stress of running a company, and also
[46:49] the ethics of running a company to
[46:51] somebody who will who will be ruthless
[46:53] and work hard and and they will end up
[46:55] making more money. But boy,
[46:58] >> yes. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting.
[47:01] There was a Supreme Court case in 1919,
[47:03] Henry Ford, actually, versus the Dodge
[47:05] brothers, and it ruled that a company's
[47:08] first interest should be to shareholders
[47:10] rather than to customers and to the
[47:12] community. And so, I think that's where
[47:14] everything went wrong. And so, you know,
[47:16] it's it's not I'm not I'm not going to
[47:17] get on a soap box about it, but it is
[47:19] important to think beyond the
[47:22] shareholder. Sometimes
[47:23] >> there are many stakeholders that are not
[47:25] shareholders. Kyla, you are an
[47:26] economist, you're a writer, you do great
[47:29] work making sense of markets and and
[47:31] vibes and power in our economy. And I
[47:33] appreciate all the work that you do on
[47:35] all of the social medias. Uh and uh you
[47:37] can check out her book. It's called In
[47:39] This Economy, and that you'll can learn
[47:42] more about what you're doing and follow
[47:44] her on all the places. Thank you for
[47:45] spending some time talking through this
[47:47] with me. Thank you.
