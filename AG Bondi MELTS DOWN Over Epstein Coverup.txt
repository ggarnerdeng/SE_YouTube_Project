1. @realitycheck3672 (878 likes): My wife; “Where were you last night? You came home at 2am Me; “The Dow is at 50,000”
2. @JonnyMOD13 (84 likes): It's utterly ridiculous to wonder where your spouse is in the middle of the night when the Dow is at 50,000. I mean come on.
3. @realitycheck3672 (14 likes): @JonnyMOD13  😂
4. @ananousous (46 likes): "Don't you ever! Accuse me when the Dow is at 50,000"
5. @ErikStraus69 (3 likes): ​ @ananousous How about if it's at 49,990? 😂
6. @talharizvi4075 (23 likes): I'm sorry, Miss Bondi - but are you implying that our economy is so integrally tied into murderous pedophiles run out of an ethno-supremacist nation that by arresting them, you will tank the economy? Perhaps we should think about restructuring our economy.
7. @iceman00behave (1 likes): ​ @talharizvi4075 Nah, not nearly that much thought was put into her responses. It was as basic as 'deny, deflect, distract.'
8. @PhantomOutlaw (0 likes): @talharizvi4075  im legit fine with the world as we know it collapsing if that means these guys face the consequences of their actions  I was literally on my way out with socialism and communism but this scandal has reinforced my socialist and communist beliefs
9. @user-rl9xd2tl4d (5 likes): Underrated comment 😂
10. @wakingminds (3 likes): MAGA Influencers: Yes, we built our wealth and careers on pushing the Epstein pedophile cabal coverup, but hey the Dow Jones is now up, so we’re not down on that anymore.
11. @coreygavin9134 (1 likes): ​ @wakingminds they wouldnt pay a 100 bucks to stop a rape!
12. @coreygavin9134 (2 likes): And she came back with a kick to the Nasdaq!!
13. @ThisNinjaSays_ (0 likes): Temu Kelly-Ann Conway.
14. @brianhoade1411 (0 likes): 😂 nice
15. @magnang (0 likes): The Dow is down to 49,500 right now - so it's fair game again.
16. @zacharykordich8513 (977 likes): “ we’re protecting pedos yes! But have you seen the economy?!” LMFAO
17. @morgielastname7364 (41 likes): Said it with survivors IN THE ROOM. They have no bottom.
18. @lokithecat-g70 (24 likes): Chairman Trump was a known Criminal, recorded at a Miss Teen USA Pageant saying "Grab them by the Pussy", who bankrupted multiple companies, while living in "Employee Housing" at a Cemetery/Spa, who hires underaged sexually abused girls in his "Spa" before they were trafficked hired to his best pal Jeffery...  And you elected him.  For the EcOnOmY?
19. @ErikStraus69 (1 likes): ​ @lokithecat-g70 Sagaar voted for him 😅
20. @Gregorypeckory (8 likes): ​​ @lokithecat-g70 Actually he was never elected. He tried to steal three elections and succeeded in the first and third; Republicans haven't legitimately won a presidential election in a long time.
21. @ma1ex (1 likes): ​ @Gregorypeckory you don't see the irony do you?
22. @micolashcage267 (2 likes): @ma1ex  If by “irony” you mean Reps having these same accusations and those being dismissed by sane people, it is because of these accusations that Reps have been able to avoid accusations against themselves for stealing elections. They literally openly did it in 2020 and yet if anyone tried to claim they cheat in elections it was dismissed.   This is a known rhetorical tactic and that people who were paying attention pointed out: accuse your opponent of your wrongdoing to undermine any future claims and put them on the defensive.
23. @firstlast4888 (0 likes): @micolashcage267  you do realize modern election denial started with Gore, then Kerry and then Clinton right?  So we’re talking a 3:1 ratio in the last 6 presidential elections….
24. @micolashcage267 (0 likes): @firstlast4888  I hate the way you all make me defend Dems - none of them ever nor anyone in their campaigns ever claimed to have an election rigged against them.   It’s frustrating having to share reality with people who refuse to live in it.
25. @firstlast4888 (0 likes): @micolashcage267  Clinton most definitely did, what the hell do you think Russia-Gate was? I think she even said something about Russian interference as recently as 2022. Gore conceded then took it back, Dems wanted to do away with the electoral college etc.  Kerry didn’t specifically but many dems questioned irregularities with some computer voting machines.
26. @micolashcage267 (0 likes): @firstlast4888   This is an absolutely hysterical view of history.   Hilary conceded the day after, never reneged. “Russiagate” is hardly exonerating of Trump when you look at all the facts - something specifically stated by Robert Mueller. They literally hacked the DNC emails the day after Trump publicly asked Russia to lol. The white wealthy dude who never gets punished for anything survived an impeachment and you guys act like it’s some sort of act of divine vindication.   Al Gore reneged his initial concession because there was a legal question - unlike Trump, Gore never got his recounts, and when it was determined that he was not getting a recount, he conceded for the final time. Can you imagine if Trump had been denied recounts? The reaction? Yet Gore, being a good little liberal believer in the establishment, conceded.   Kerry is just a dumb one to bring up and you know it because you literally don’t even have any specific misinformation you can point to.   When you openly lie, you make me defend the Dems - if anything, the truth of these stories make them look like sniveling cowards rather than insidious puppet masters. You essentially take the ramblings of a mythomaniac with extreme incentive to lie and equate that with actual situations with actual questions. Its this blatant dishonesty and appeals to false narratives right wingers and “centrists” engage in that makes me queasy.
27. @olorin1710 (0 likes): ​ @firstlast4888  interesting,  once again Florida doing cover ups. In Gores win and Epsteins crimes.
28. @phillyrocks3847 (0 likes): ​ @lokithecat-g70 Not at a teen USA thing but keep lying.
29. @AnonymousPersonAP (0 likes): ​ @lokithecat-g70  you should wirk in Hollywood, you are a great fictional writer
30. @wesleystreet (2 likes): @AnonymousPersonAP  Everything stated was factual. Care to respond?

=== TRANSCRIPT (TIMESTAMPED) ===
[00:04] Good morning everybody. Happy Thursday.
[00:06] We have an amazing show for everybody
[00:07] today. What do we have Crystal?
[00:08] >> Indeed we do. Attorney General Pam Bondi
[00:10] grilled over her Epstein coverup. Did
[00:13] not go all that well for her. Uh
[00:15] shifting narratives over that El Paso
[00:17] airport closure. Sager has his own
[00:19] theories. You will be unsurprised to
[00:21] learn. Um we've got the breakdown after
[00:23] BB comes yet again to DC and meets with
[00:25] Trump pushing for war with Iran. Body
[00:28] camera footage from a CBP shooting in
[00:30] Chicago that we've covered extensively
[00:32] here has been released and definitively
[00:34] proves that the government was lying
[00:36] from the start. Cash Patel screwing up
[00:38] the Nancy Guthrie investigation. You
[00:40] would probably not be surprised to learn
[00:41] about that either. A viral essay is
[00:43] warning that AI is about to change
[00:45] absolutely everything. And the author of
[00:48] the Nazi and the Psychiatrist is going
[00:50] to join us to talk about what we learned
[00:51] about human beings at Nerburgg. So that
[00:54] should be really interesting.
[00:54] >> Yeah, it's exciting. His book for those
[00:56] who haven't seen uh was the basis of the
[00:59] movie Nermberg uh with Russell Crowe and
[01:01] Rammy Malik. I thought it was an
[01:02] incredible film. I actually did not know
[01:04] that much about Goring and I I not only
[01:06] uh you know researched some of what this
[01:08] guy wrote about in his book but actually
[01:09] bought a few biographies himself. So
[01:11] this the movie itself I highly
[01:12] recommend. I'm excited to talk to the
[01:14] author. Before we get to that, thank you
[01:16] to everybody who has been supporting the
[01:17] show breakingpoints.com. Just this
[01:19] morning, we were going through and
[01:20] looking at all of our Epstein coverage,
[01:22] which gets demonetized for several
[01:24] hours, meaning that we can earn no
[01:26] revenue despite the fact that these are
[01:28] racking up hundreds of thousands of
[01:29] views. We will continue to do so because
[01:31] we don't have to care about YouTube ad
[01:33] revenue, but in order to for that to be
[01:35] the case, we do need people to support
[01:36] the show. Breaking Points.com, if you
[01:38] are able to. If you're just watching
[01:40] this on YouTube, then no worries. Please
[01:42] hit subscribe on YouTube to our channel.
[01:44] And if you're listening to this as a
[01:45] podcast, please share an episode with a
[01:47] friend. It really helps other people
[01:48] find the show. But with that, let's go
[01:50] ahead and start with Pam Bondi and her
[01:52] disastrous debut uh before the United
[01:54] States Congress.
[01:55] >> Yeah. So, she uh was there to testify
[01:58] and took a lot of heat, mostly from
[01:59] Democrats, but also significant heat
[02:01] from Thomas Massie. Let's go ahead and
[02:03] take a listen to what he had to say.
[02:05] >> Who's responsible? Are you able to track
[02:08] who in your organization made this
[02:11] massive failure and released the
[02:12] victim's names? Are you able to track
[02:14] who it was that obscured Les Wexner's
[02:18] name as a co-conspirator in an FBI
[02:21] document? Do you have that kind of
[02:24] accountability?
[02:26] >> I believe Wexner's name was listed more
[02:30] than 4,000 times about I had
[02:32] >> Yeah, I already told you that. This is
[02:33] where he's listed as a
[02:35] >> finish my answer. Come on, let me finish
[02:38] my answer. We corrected that within 40
[02:41] minutes. He was already You're acting
[02:43] like everybody's trying to cover up
[02:45] Wexner's name. Reclaiming Reclaiming my
[02:47] time. I'm going to answer this question.
[02:48] Reclaiming my time. Within 40 minutes,
[02:52] Wexner's name was added back.
[02:53] >> Within 40 minutes of me catching you
[02:56] red-handed.
[02:57] >> Red hand. There was one redaction
[03:00] listed as a coke and we invited you in.
[03:05] We This guy has Trump derangement
[03:06] syndrome. He needs to get You're a
[03:08] failed politician.
[03:10] >> Trump's derangement syndrome. failed
[03:12] politician. She had a whole binder that
[03:14] was her burn book with um research on
[03:18] all of the members who'd be questioning
[03:20] her, specifically the Democrats, but
[03:21] probably also Thomas Massie, so that she
[03:24] could rather than responding to their
[03:25] questions say, "Oh, yeah, well, what
[03:27] about when you voted for impeachment or
[03:29] what about when you did this?" and
[03:31] deflect and distract and attack them
[03:34] rather than actually responding to the
[03:35] queries that they're making here. You
[03:37] know, another thing that I think it was
[03:38] Thomas Massie and maybe others as well
[03:40] that pointed out Sager in this hearing
[03:41] is, you know, you were given a list of
[03:45] victims from their lawyer saying, "Hey,
[03:48] here's the names of some of the the
[03:50] women, the survivors that were involved.
[03:52] Please make sure that these names are
[03:54] redacted." That email gets released. All
[03:58] of the women's names are there in that
[04:01] email. But it's not like they just
[04:03] missed it and like, "Oops, we didn't see
[04:05] this for redaction." They redacted the
[04:08] lawyer's name and left all of the women
[04:12] in there. Yeah.
[04:13] >> So, he really had her and a number of
[04:15] them did had her dead to rights on what
[04:17] a screw-up and how almost it seems
[04:19] intentionally malevolent the way that
[04:21] they uh redacted and released these.
[04:24] Even with Wexner, uh, to the extent that
[04:26] his name was in the files some 4,000
[04:28] times, when you redact his name as a
[04:31] co-conspirator in the DOJ documents,
[04:33] that's kind of significant, isn't it?
[04:34] Unredact the names of said victims.
[04:37] Again, let's be very clear, as Massie
[04:39] pointed out to her directly, she
[04:41] violated the law. The law said you're
[04:44] only vi you only get to redact national
[04:46] security and victim's name. That's it.
[04:48] Everything else needs to be unredacted.
[04:51] They violated the law on numerous
[04:52] occasions. And then even then they
[04:54] didn't do a very good job. So in some
[04:56] cases I would look a name would be
[04:57] redacted in one exchange. In another
[04:59] case I would look and then you know the
[05:01] very same email chain they forgot to
[05:03] redacted in this one. It's a clown show
[05:05] the entire thing. What was even worse
[05:07] though is that Bondi is doing this thing
[05:10] where you know all Trump officials when
[05:12] they're in an indefensible position what
[05:14] do they do? Attack. Attack. Attack.
[05:16] Except she because she's on such
[05:18] indefensible ground ends up looking like
[05:21] a lunatic. And the best example is this
[05:24] clip where she shreds the politicians
[05:26] for asking her about doing her job and
[05:29] is like, "Hey, the Dow Jones just hit
[05:31] 50,000. Why don't you guys care about
[05:33] that?" Take a listen.
[05:34] >> The Dow has shattered 50,000 for the
[05:38] first time. This is crazy. They said it
[05:41] couldn't be done in four years. Yet,
[05:43] President Trump has done it in one year.
[05:47] National median rents have fallen to a
[05:50] 4-year low thanks to Donald Trump.
[05:54] That's why they want to focus on Epstein
[05:57] and our most transparent president in
[06:00] the nation's history. The murder rate,
[06:04] as I said, has plummeted to a 125y year
[06:09] low thanks to Donald Trump.
[06:12] >> Well, uh, the Dow has sh First of all,
[06:14] nobody said that it couldn't be done. In
[06:16] fact, it's not even all that remarkable
[06:17] because as we learned under the Biden
[06:19] administration, great gains in the S&P
[06:21] 500 or the Dow Jones does not mean that
[06:24] you are doing well all that financially
[06:26] at a middle class level. But second,
[06:28] that is the level that they have been
[06:31] reduced to is look at the stock market.
[06:34] And this has actually become a huge meme
[06:35] online is, you know, somebody will ask
[06:37] you a question be like, "Hey babe, did
[06:38] you do the dishes?" And be like, "The
[06:39] Dow's at 50,000, you Get off of
[06:42] my case." You know,
[06:44] >> don't you know the 50,000? I'm going to
[06:46] try that next time. You're wearing shoes
[06:48] in the house. The Dow is at 50,000.
[06:50] >> How dare you?
[06:51] >> How dare you ask me to take my shoes
[06:54] with rocks salt off in my house.
[06:56] >> I mean, but and here's the thing,
[06:57] though. I mean, she looks ridiculous to
[07:00] any reasonable person. The Dow thing was
[07:04] just utterly preposterous. But her
[07:06] response to all of them just so
[07:07] performative. You know, having the burn
[07:09] book there so that she can, you know,
[07:11] she can have her little one on one line
[07:14] zingers against this and that person
[07:16] rather than responding to their queries.
[07:17] It all looks utterly pathetic. But but
[07:21] there's only one person that she has to
[07:23] make happy. And I think Trump probably
[07:24] did like this performance. I think that
[07:26] stock market line probably hits really
[07:28] hard with the president of the United
[07:30] States. And that's why it's in there. I
[07:31] mean, it wouldn't surprise me if she was
[07:33] working directly, you know, with his top
[07:35] staff and communications team to come up
[07:37] with that line, to come up with the
[07:39] whole approach and all the, you know,
[07:40] the burnbook research and all the rest.
[07:42] >> Yeah. I will say I had no for a little
[07:44] bit in terms of some sources is that the
[07:46] White House in particular is really
[07:48] taking an interest in comms for the
[07:50] whole administration and so you can see
[07:52] this, right? Well, especially Epstein,
[07:54] this is the most sensitive thing that
[07:56] they're currently facing at a national
[07:58] level. So, if this really is the best
[08:00] they could come up with, like you, why
[08:02] not just actually do your job? You know,
[08:05] then you would have no criticism to have
[08:07] to deal with. And every every day that
[08:09] this goes on and this type of behavior,
[08:12] you are covering some major up.
[08:14] There's just no other explanation.
[08:16] >> That's right. That's right. And I mean,
[08:17] and and here's the other thing. No one
[08:19] else is Trump. Like, they all try to
[08:20] pull off like the the Trump mode and
[08:22] they just end up looking silly. But
[08:24] look, again, she needed to perform well
[08:27] for the president to save her ass and
[08:29] keep herself in the job. And I think he
[08:30] probably was just fine with this
[08:32] performance. Um, let's go ahead and take
[08:33] a look at this was another m I mean,
[08:35] this is something I already knew. But
[08:37] it's just, you know, it really is
[08:38] stunning that they're posturing like,
[08:41] oh, there was no one, no other crimes
[08:43] uncovered here, nothing for us even to
[08:45] further investigate. Time to turn the
[08:47] page. It's a hoax, etc., etc. Well, a
[08:50] lot of the survivors were in the room
[08:52] and so Primila Gyipol asked them, "Hey,
[08:54] you know, did the DOJ ever reach out to
[08:57] you? Were you willing to speak with
[08:58] them? Did they ever reach out to you for
[09:00] any sort of investigation?" And of
[09:01] course, the answer is no, because
[09:03] they're not interested, of course, in,
[09:06] you know, accountability for any of the
[09:08] powerful men that are implicated in
[09:10] this. They're interested in trying to
[09:12] cover the whole thing up and move on.
[09:14] Let's take a listen to that moment. To
[09:17] the survivors in the room, if you are
[09:20] willing, please stand.
[09:26] And if you are willing, please raise
[09:28] your hands. If you have still not been
[09:32] able to meet with this Department of
[09:34] Justice,
[09:38] please know for the record that every
[09:39] single survivor has raised their hand.
[09:42] Attorney General Bondi,
[09:46] you apologize to the survivors in your
[09:48] opening statement for what they went
[09:50] through at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein.
[09:53] Will you turn to them now and apologize
[09:57] for what your Department of Justice has
[10:00] put them through with the un
[10:04] absolutely unacceptable release
[10:07] of the Epstein files and their
[10:10] information.
[10:16] Congresswoman, you sat before
[10:20] Mer Merritt Garland sat in this chair
[10:22] twice. Attorney General Bonnie can
[10:25] finish my answer. No, I'm going to
[10:27] reclaim my time because I asked you
[10:29] attorney specific question.
[10:31] >> Attorney General
[10:33] to answer which is will you turn to the
[10:36] survivors? This is not about anybody
[10:39] that came before you. It is about you
[10:41] taking responsibility for your
[10:43] Department of Justice and the harm that
[10:46] it has done to the survivors who are
[10:49] standing right behind you and are
[10:51] waiting for you to turn to them and
[10:54] apologize for what your Department of
[10:56] Justice is.
[10:57] >> Members members get to ask the
[10:59] questions. The witness gets to answer in
[11:00] the way they want to answer the attorney
[11:02] general.
[11:02] >> That's not accurate, Mr. Chairman.
[11:04] >> Because she doesn't like the answer. So,
[11:06] um,
[11:07] >> Mr. Mr. Chairman, I have asked she asked
[11:10] Meritt Garland this
[11:13] reclaiming my time and when I will
[11:17] chairman the general get in the gutter
[11:19] for her theatrics.
[11:21] >> Going to get in the gutter for her
[11:23] theatrics when she's saying, "Hey, can
[11:25] you apologize to these women that you've
[11:27] shown no interest in hearing their side
[11:29] of the story?" And there you see Bondie
[11:32] trying to use her little burn book. Oh,
[11:33] well, what about Merrick Garland?
[11:35] Merrick Garland came up, by the way. a
[11:36] lot from her in this hearing.
[11:38] >> Well, it doesn't make first of all, the
[11:39] Meritt Garland thing is really stupid
[11:42] because Merrick Garland did not come in
[11:44] from an administration that said we're
[11:45] going to have total transparency on this
[11:48] very issue. Merrick Garland did not
[11:50] gather a bunch of influencers at the
[11:51] White House some one year ago and hand
[11:53] out binders that said the Epstein files
[11:56] part one. Merrick Garland uh did not,
[11:58] you know, uh Merrick Garland was not
[12:01] under the obligation to release all of
[12:03] this information. He didn't say this is
[12:05] all sitting on my desk and I'm just
[12:06] reviewing it.
[12:07] >> Exactly. And I have the names of
[12:09] thousands of people and of the clients.
[12:11] I what didn't she quite literally say
[12:13] she had the client list on her desk like
[12:15] months before this entire thing even
[12:17] kicked off where they said that there
[12:19] was absolutely nothing to see here. So
[12:20] that's not on Mayor Garland. Now should
[12:22] have other administrations, the Bush
[12:24] administration, Obama, Biden administr
[12:26] Trump first Trump administration, should
[12:27] they have all done? Yeah, sure. Okay.
[12:29] Absolutely. But not like we ever stopped
[12:32] talking about it at the time, but that
[12:34] is actually immaterial to the question.
[12:36] Now, you clearly did not meet with any
[12:38] of the people who were actually affected
[12:40] by Jeffrey. Can you ever think of a
[12:42] similar situation where you have people
[12:44] who are purported victims who have been
[12:47] unmet but with the actual authorities in
[12:50] charge? These are the people who are
[12:52] supposed to protect you. and instead
[12:54] they're redacting the names of the
[12:55] people who are rich and who are powerful
[12:57] who are directly implicated in this
[12:59] entire thing. So it was shameful the
[13:01] entire her entire uh performance was
[13:04] actually one of the worst I have ever
[13:06] seen and on this issue. Look, you're
[13:09] saying it's going to please Trump. I'm
[13:10] not I just think you know not even Fox
[13:13] News or any of these other people could
[13:14] defend it. Nobody. It's indefensible.
[13:16] >> How did they just not talk about it?
[13:18] >> They cut away from it. Fox. So this is
[13:21] by the way extraordinary. In the middle
[13:22] of the day, nobody is watching cable TV.
[13:26] The only purpose of cable TV in the
[13:28] middle of the day is for live events,
[13:29] stuff like this. CNN and MSNBC and Fox
[13:32] were all carrying it live. As it started
[13:34] to go off the rails, they cut away to
[13:36] talk about, I don't know, Bad Bunny
[13:37] again. Yeah. Right. But like for real,
[13:39] that that is Kid Rock. That is as tacit
[13:42] of an admission as you are ever going to
[13:44] get uh from the Fox News Network. All
[13:46] right, let's get to uh A4. This was
[13:49] another one. Um her performance with Ted
[13:51] Lou it's un I mean this woman is
[13:54] becoming unglued like actually unhinged.
[13:57] Let's take a listen.
[13:58] >> Former Prince Andrew Donald Trump
[14:00] attended various parties with Jeffrey
[14:02] Epstein. I want to know were there any
[14:06] underage girls at that party or at any
[14:08] party that Trump attended with Jeffrey
[14:11] Epstein?
[14:18] This is so ridiculous and that they are
[14:21] trying to deflect
[14:24] from all the great things Donald Trump
[14:26] has done. There is no evidence that
[14:29] Donald Trump has committed a crime.
[14:31] Everyone knows that this has been the
[14:32] most transparent presidency. He's the
[14:35] one that those
[14:37] >> I'm reclaim my time. I'm going to put up
[14:39] another document from a witness who
[14:43] called the FBI's National Threat
[14:44] Operations Center because I believe you
[14:47] just lied under oath. There is ample
[14:49] evidence in the Epstein file.
[14:51] >> Don't you ever accuse me of a crime.
[14:53] >> I believe you just lied under oath and
[14:55] this is all on videotape. You said
[14:57] there's no evidence of a crime. I'm
[14:58] showing you here is
[15:00] >> a witness statement who called into the
[15:02] FBI's threat operations center.
[15:04] >> Don't you ever accuse me of a crime.
[15:07] Look, again, I can only say you should
[15:10] all be absolutely ashamed that this
[15:12] woman, you know, is in any way in power
[15:15] and anything that can be I mean, I wish
[15:17] I could say, "Oh, Lutnik and her and all
[15:19] them should be held to account, but
[15:21] they're not." You know, the one saving
[15:22] grace uh if you want to see these people
[15:25] pay is if and I actually saw I think it
[15:27] was Mike Cernovich who said this. He was
[15:29] like, "Yeah, these bondi hearings, this
[15:30] is what it's going to look like every
[15:31] single day if the Democrats take power."
[15:32] And it's true. I mean, and I've like
[15:34] these people, every single person in the
[15:37] administration will be living on Capitol
[15:39] Hill if this if the Democrats take even
[15:41] just the House in the midterm. So, gear
[15:44] up for a preview because this is exactly
[15:46] what it's going to look like.
[15:47] >> Well, and it got even worse after the
[15:48] fact. We learned something that is also
[15:50] pretty astonishing. Put A6 up on the
[15:52] screen. So, you know, lawmakers have
[15:54] been able to go in and uh view the
[15:57] unredacted Epstein files. They got four
[16:00] computers set up and so you could go in
[16:02] and search and Jamie Rascin did that.
[16:04] Permila Jipal did that. Thomas Massie,
[16:06] Roana, there were a number of lawmakers
[16:08] who went in to conduct their own
[16:09] searches. And it turns out in that burn
[16:13] book, you can see here this document.
[16:16] Keep this up on the screen. It says
[16:18] Gyipol Primila search history. and it
[16:22] has the list of all the searches that
[16:25] she made when she went in to view the
[16:29] unredacted files. More information has
[16:32] come out. It looks like they retained
[16:34] the search history from all of the
[16:37] lawmakers that went in to view these
[16:40] files so they could use it to help
[16:42] inform her testimony here and so that
[16:44] they could keep track of what exactly it
[16:47] was that lawmakers were interested in
[16:49] and what they were what they were
[16:51] looking at, what they were searching
[16:52] for. And I mean, this is very like this
[16:55] is pretty outrageous behavior to be
[16:58] tracking and surveilling them in this
[17:00] manner when they're trying to view these
[17:01] files and hold the administration to
[17:03] account.
[17:04] >> Yeah. And also, it comes to a question
[17:05] of resources. It's like that's what
[17:06] you're spending your time, your spy
[17:08] resources on on what we're searching on.
[17:10] I, by the way, you know what's funny?
[17:11] Even with my own cynicism, I never once
[17:14] thought, oh, they're going to keep track
[17:15] of all my keystrokes that I type into
[17:17] the DOJ website for all of the guess I
[17:19] have to now. Totally. I guess we should
[17:21] all be doing this on what I mean I can't
[17:22] even duck duck go or something uh and
[17:25] make sure that you're on a lockdown mode
[17:26] enabled computer if you're in any if
[17:28] you're listening to this you're a
[17:30] researcher or you're somebody who's in
[17:31] power this is not something I mean again
[17:34] my own naivee never once was like oh
[17:37] yeah they're just going to keep records
[17:38] of everything that we're searching kind
[17:40] of makes sense though like all they have
[17:41] to do is link your IP address even if
[17:43] you're using a VPN apparently they have
[17:45] ways around it maybe someday next week
[17:47] we'll talk about this Paragon leak
[17:48] because I'm obsessed with this story
[17:50] about uh you know some it's an Israeli
[17:53] uh spy technology tool that was leaked
[17:55] but just goes to the extent where signal
[17:57] WhatsApp end to-end encryption I mean
[17:59] the Pegasus stuff seems to be old news
[18:01] at this point for their ability to crack
[18:03] into whatever you want but this is what
[18:04] they're using it for is to literally
[18:06] measure and look at the keystrokes and
[18:08] the clip uh the clicks of what you are
[18:10] you know searching and and and making
[18:12] sure that you're pulling up. I mean that
[18:13] is shocking behavior right like using a
[18:16] unique link to spy on members of
[18:18] Congress. Once upon a time, we used to
[18:20] be very upset about stuff like that. I
[18:22] we do we would be remiss if we didn't
[18:24] talk about some of the other little
[18:26] Epstein developments. Can we put uh A5
[18:29] up on the screen? I don't know what to
[18:30] make of this. Uh but we'll present it
[18:33] nonetheless. So, The Ditch, which I I
[18:35] hadn't heard of this website before, but
[18:37] you know, they do some investigative
[18:39] reporting. So, what they have found is
[18:41] they gained access to Jeffrey Epstein's
[18:44] FedEx account with records showing it
[18:46] was used for shipments long after his
[18:49] death and an address book that included
[18:52] a senior Israeli military officer, now
[18:55] considered to be a quote strategic
[18:57] consultant for diplomatic matters. One
[19:00] of the shipments was actually sent less
[19:01] than two years ago and it was delivered
[19:03] to a dissolved company that owned and
[19:05] operated Epstein's private jet. They
[19:08] were able to find this from an
[19:09] unredacted password of Epstein's FedEx
[19:11] account. They were able to log in, look
[19:13] at the overall address book, but you
[19:15] have multiple individuals here where
[19:18] first of all, it shows that the address
[19:19] thing is live, which you know, again,
[19:22] we're always talking about innocent
[19:23] explanations here. Could be used by his
[19:25] estate or, you know, some of the other
[19:27] uh operators of the people who are like
[19:29] trustees. However, uh you know, despite
[19:32] the fact they died in 2019, they're
[19:34] using it as recently as summer of 2024
[19:36] and they're sending products to all of
[19:38] these various different uh you know,
[19:40] shell companies that were owned by
[19:42] Epste, but the address book itself shows
[19:44] at some point he was sending or
[19:46] receiving things from this senior
[19:48] Israeli officer. So, just another crumb
[19:50] uh that we have over there.
[19:51] >> And there's one more we wanted to put in
[19:53] the show to put A7 up on the screen. So,
[19:55] Columbia University Dental School is
[19:59] acknowledging that they admitted an
[20:01] Epstein girlfriend via quote an
[20:03] irregular process. And they're forced to
[20:06] admit this because there were all kinds
[20:08] of emails in here between, you know,
[20:11] Epstein or his associates and members of
[20:13] the, you know, high level members of
[20:15] this dental school where they're
[20:17] soliciting contributions. he's giving
[20:19] them hundreds of thousands of dollars
[20:21] and very clearly in exchange they're
[20:23] letting this woman who is not actually
[20:24] qualified to be in this dental school
[20:26] into the dental school. So um you know
[20:29] and this was this was going on for quite
[20:31] a long time. There's all these exchanges
[20:33] about how they're easing her way in and
[20:35] she's not having to meet the
[20:37] requirements. They're like don't worry
[20:38] about having to take the test etc etc.
[20:41] So, you know, he was able to and we we
[20:43] also covered him, you know, paying the
[20:45] tuition of the Satan Hall University um
[20:48] tuition for the children of the governor
[20:50] of the Virgin Islands, but Columbia
[20:52] University here happy to take his money
[20:54] and let in whoever he wanted to get into
[20:57] their schools. Just humiliating.
[20:59] >> Well, you know what I put together is do
[21:00] you remember that picture from the
[21:02] island with the dentist?
[21:04] >> The dental chair
[21:06] >> with the all the masks that were sitting
[21:07] around there.
[21:09] Like
[21:09] >> the dentist thing keeps coming up.
[21:11] >> Something about dentistry and I'm I'm
[21:14] not depraved enough uh to find it
[21:16] myself. I've looked a little bit into
[21:18] it. I'm thinking what do you think? Like
[21:20] maybe the nerve gases access to
[21:22] something like that. Right.
[21:24] >> I I have some darker thoughts in my
[21:26] head.
[21:26] >> Yeah. Maybe it's literally about like
[21:28] you know removing.
[21:30] This is the issue with with this story
[21:32] is you really start to descend into the
[21:35] depths of madness and you're like what
[21:37] is true and what is for example with the
[21:39] FedEx thing you're like okay the
[21:41] innocent explanation is his trusty you
[21:43] know estate or whatever is using it what
[21:45] if he's alive right and that's another
[21:47] one we were like I don't know I mean I I
[21:49] I would have given it what a 0% chance
[21:52] now I would give it a one%
[21:54] >> theory I that one I I really thought was
[21:56] like oh that's just kooky like no he's
[21:58] not still alive what are we talking
[21:59] about like you Oh yeah, and so is Elvis.
[22:01] You know, it's And now I'm like maybe
[22:04] >> Yeah, I would give it I would give it
[22:06] 1%. If not zero, I'll give it 1%.
[22:08] >> I'm a more like 10 to 20.
[22:10] >> Wow, that that's I don't I'm like I you
[22:13] know, and that's the thing like you said
[22:14] with the dentistry thing.
[22:16] >> I you you do start to feel like because
[22:18] then you see you see the ocean pour, you
[22:20] see the sulfuric acid, you see the way
[22:22] they talk to each other. Loved the
[22:24] torture video. All these weird
[22:27] references to beef jerky. like it's like
[22:29] >> grape soda,
[22:30] >> grape soda, pizza, all of it. And you're
[22:33] like,
[22:34] >> there's no way these people are hanging
[22:36] out together and getting grape soda and
[22:38] pizza all the time, right?
[22:39] >> Or that he's this into jerky that it's
[22:42] like a priority matter that his
[22:44] assistants are constantly communicating
[22:46] with each other about. We got to make
[22:47] sure we got enough jerky on the island.
[22:49] And but then you ask like, am I just I
[22:51] don't know. But some of the things are
[22:52] so dark in there that you can't put
[22:55] anything literally anything out of
[22:57] bounds.
[22:58] >> Yeah. Can I can I just read you another
[22:59] one here? I know someone flagged this to
[23:02] me yesterday. Epstein, July 19, 2011.
[23:05] Quote, said she felt God's presence next
[23:07] to her when she was in bed. She knows
[23:09] that Jesus watches over her and he
[23:11] helped save her life. Whoops. Then
[23:14] follow up.
[23:15] >> This is another one that people are
[23:16] flagging
[23:17] >> from Epstein to redacted. Then two from
[23:20] Epstein. You should dress up as him when
[23:23] you see her. This is like I I mean, you
[23:26] know, not to sound like a 1980s satanic
[23:29] pan, but like this is satanic. Like
[23:31] literally, I I don't know. I I I just
[23:34] there's so much of that. The torture
[23:36] video, I mean, all the famous stuff. But
[23:38] it's like every other day somebody will
[23:39] just send me one. I'll go oh my god.
[23:41] First my instinct is, is it real? Then I
[23:43] search it. I find that it is real and
[23:44] I'm like, what what is happening here?
[23:46] >> Yeah, I know. There was a Did you see
[23:48] this new one about uh Leon Black that
[23:50] came up? It's a allegation from a lawyer
[23:53] about her, you know, the client she's
[23:55] representing.
[23:56] >> Yeah.
[23:56] >> Allegations against him.
[23:58] >> She says when she was 16
[24:00] >> that she was raped by Leon Black. I'm
[24:03] sure he denies all of this. Put this out
[24:04] there for the lawyers. Um that when she
[24:06] was 16, she was raped by Leon Black. He
[24:09] bit her on her genitals, injured her,
[24:13] >> that she was bleeding, they wouldn't
[24:14] take her to the doctor, and then they
[24:16] flew her out the next day.
[24:17] >> So that was a 2023 lawsuit.
[24:20] Yeah. Wow. I'm looking
[24:22] >> and I I mean I looked at same thing. I
[24:23] was like, "Is this real? Look it up."
[24:24] Yeah, it's there. It's there in the
[24:26] files.
[24:26] >> Right. So, Oh, yeah. This is a July 2023
[24:28] story. I actually didn't even know.
[24:29] >> And you want to tell me
[24:30] >> she was had Down syndrome according to
[24:32] this a according to the
[24:34] >> lawyer. Yeah. Again, he denies it. You
[24:36] know, we'll vigorously defend himself.
[24:38] >> And this is part of, you know, in terms
[24:40] of the cover up, right? They're telling
[24:42] us there's nothing here to more to
[24:44] investigate. Okay. Why? Maybe you should
[24:46] talk to the victims if and see whether
[24:48] there's anything. No, there's nothing to
[24:50] investigate. Okay. Well, then we need to
[24:52] see. You had a list of potential
[24:54] co-conspirators.
[24:56] When and how was the decision made that
[24:58] there was nothing chargeable here? That
[24:59] there was no there there that we don't
[25:01] need to pursue this any further. That's
[25:03] not in these files. That has not been
[25:05] identified in these files. So, where is
[25:07] that documentation? Because somewhere
[25:08] along the way, there was a government
[25:11] decision that was made. We're not going
[25:13] to look into this any further. We don't
[25:15] think there's any there there or for
[25:16] whatever reason, we're moving on. Okay,
[25:19] how did that process occur? Because we
[25:21] don't get any of that there. Instead, we
[25:23] get, you know, redacted list of
[25:25] co-conspirators that they have to be put
[25:26] on blast in order to identify any of the
[25:28] people that they were looking at. And
[25:30] then we're just told, don't worry about
[25:32] it. There's nothing to see here. No
[25:34] further investigations. It's just
[25:36] Epstein and just Maxwell, and there's no
[25:38] one else who's implicated in this
[25:40] massive crime criminal enterprise
[25:42] whatsoever.
[25:43] >> Yes, that's right. All right, man. So
[25:45] disgusting. Hey, if you like that video,
